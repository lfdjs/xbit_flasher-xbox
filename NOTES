The X-BIT really seems to be a pile of garbage when it comes to its USB
interface. I failed with the original software on a trusty old Pentium Pro
with first gen USB (the machine has exactly one USB port!).

Then I tried this tool on Linux on a shoddy HP laptop which also failed.
8086:0f35 Intel Corporation Atom Processor Z36xxx/Z37xxx, Celeron N2000 Series USB xHCI (rev 0e)

Next I thought maybe give AMD a try and connected the chip to an
MSI GF615M-P33 V2(MS-7597) mainboard (some AM3 platform)
It was one of these controllers:
10de:03f1 NVIDIA Corporation MCP61 USB 1.1 Controller (rev a3)
10de:03f2 NVIDIA Corporation MCP61 USB 2.0 Controller (rev a3)

First try, the tool didn't recognize the modchip. Looking at dmesg, the
'Manufacturer' field was read as 'ST Micrnics' (wow).
After simply replugging the chip, it now read 'ST Microelectronics' and
everything was fine. Formatting worked, flashing worked, everything
was fine, which was a bit surprising because previous research brought
up an old thread where it was claimed that nforce chipsets would be
the worst when trying to deal with the X-BIT, and VIA chips were recommended
instead.
